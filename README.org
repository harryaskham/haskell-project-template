#+TITLE: Haskell Project Template

A simple Cabal + Nix project template intended for snapshotting to quickstart a new project.

* Defaults
- Comes with a recent ~base~ and ~cabal~ version, with ~relude~ enabled instead of ~Prelude~
- An opinionated set of default language extensions are enabled by default
- Most warnings from ~-Weverything~ are enabled

* Getting Started
- Clone this repo or copy its contents into a fresh repo (including ~.gitignore~)
- Rename ~projectname.cabal~ to the actual project name
- Replace all instances of ~projectname~ with the actual project name: ~find . -type f | xargs sed -i "" "s/projectname/realname/g"~

* Running
- To run with Cabal, ~cabal run projectname~
- To run with Nix manually, ~cabal2nix . > default.nix && nix-build release.nix && result/bin/projectname~
- To run with Nix automatically, ~cabal --enable-nix run projectname~
- For GHCi, ~cabal v2-repl~ or ~cabal --enable-nix v2-repl~
- To refresh ~shell.nix~ and open a Nix shell, ~cabal2nix --shell ./. >shell.nix && nix-shell~

* Testing
- ~cabal test~ will run the contents of ~test/TestSuite.hs~ initially
- Running with nix manually above will run both the tests and the project by default

* Adding New Modules
- For every new module added, ~projectname.cabal~ needs it explicitly adding to all exposed module lists.
- We also need to run ~~/.cabal/bin/gen-hie . > hie.yaml~ for HLS to pick the new modules up.
