#+TITLE: Haskell Project Template

A simple Cabal + Nix project template. For personal use, will change a lot in backwards-incompatible ways.

~projectname.cabal~ is the source of truth, with Nix deriving everything from here.

* Defaults
- An opinionated set of default language extensions are enabled by default
- Most warnings from ~-Weverything~ are enabled

* Getting Started
- Clone this repo
- Rename ~projectname.cabal~ to the actual project name
- Replace all instances of ~projectname~ with the actual project name:
  - ~find . -type f | xargs sed -i "" "s/projectname/realname/g"~

* Running
- To run with Cabal, ~cabal run~
- To run with Nix, ~cabal2nix . > default.nix && nix-build release.nix && result/bin/projectname~
- For GHCi, ~cabal v2-repl~
- Nix GHCi not yet supported (may require migrating to ~haskell.nix~)

* Adding New Modules
- For every new module added, ~projectname.cabal~ needs updating.
- We also need to run ~gen-hie . > hie.yaml~ for HLS to pick the new modules up.
